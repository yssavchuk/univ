Lab 4: Memory management

1. [Study modern os' memory manager simulator.](http://www.ontko.com/moss/#memory)
2. Create and run the command file that corresponds to (0,1,...) reference string.
3. Answer instructor questions.
4. Fix bugs.
5. Implement one of the following page replacement algorithms:
  * **LRU approximation using bit matrix** (implemented)
    * [*Algorithm explanation*](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgxk/courses/g53ops/Memory%20Management/MM14-LRU.html)
  * Round-robin
  * NRU
  * Clock
  * LRU
  * Working set
  * WSClock
6. Measure relative performance of replacement algorithm implemented
